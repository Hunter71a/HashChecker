# HashChecker

The Hash-O-Matic XL3000 redefines hashing with style and precision. This windows form application uses built in hashing
from System.Windows.Cryptology to quickly and conveniently test your SHA256 or other checksum value. For testing purposes,
be sure to run visual studio with administrator privileges to avoid windows blocking access to user information and your
file turning up empty.
